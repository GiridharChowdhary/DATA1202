 # LAB DESCRIPTION
   In this project, I have used Assignment 3 from Data 1202. In the assignment, We have levaraged the data by using vgsales dataset. The main objective of the assignment is to    find if the average global sales is higher after 2005 or before 2005 and we are supposed to create a new column where the video games sales before 2005 will be labelled as   ‘pre-2005’ and the sales after 2005 will be labelled as ‘post-2005’. What we have done is, we have written a code using vgsales paramenters for both the given conditions and   have created a document explaining the process involved in the steps and the code.
